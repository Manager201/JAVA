/*
A prime number is said to be twisted prime, if the new number obtained after reversing the digits is also a prime number.
Given two positive integers m and n, where m<n, Write a program to determine how many twisted primes are there in the
range between m and n (both inclusive) and output them.
Input: m = 100, n =200
Output: The Twisted Prime Numbers are: 101 107 113 131 149 151 157 167 179 181 191 199
Frequency of Twisted Prime Numbers is: 12
