/*
Write a program to declare a matrix a[ ][ ] of order r x c, where r is the number of rows and c is the number of columns. Input
positive integers into this matrix. Perform the following tasks:
a) Display the original matrix
b) Check if the given matrix is Skew Symmetric or not. A square matrix is said to be Skew Symmetric if the element of
the ith row and jth column is equal to the negative value of the jth row and ith column.
c) Find the sum of the elements of left diagonal, sum of the elements of right diagonal and sum of border elements of
the matrix and display them.
Example: 1) Input: r=3, c=4
Output: Not a square matrix
2) Input: r=4, c=4
0 -1 -5 -3
1  0 6  9
5 -6 0 -2
3 -9 2  0
Output:
Original Matrix
0 -1 -5 -3
1  0  6  9
5 -6  0 -2
3 -9  2  0
The Given Matrix is Skew Symmetric.
The sum of the left diagonal = 0
The sum of the right diagonal = 0
The sum of the border elements = 0
