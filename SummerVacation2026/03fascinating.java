/*
Write a program to input a number and check whether it is a Fascinating No. or not.
(Fascinating Numbers: Some numbers of 3 digits or more exhibit a very interesting property. The property is such that, when
the number is multiplied by 2 and 3, and both these products are concatenated with the original number, all digits from 1 to 9
are present exactly once, regardless of the number of zeroes.)
Example:
192x1=192
192x2=384
192x3=576
Concatenating the results: 192 384 576
