Accept two positive integers m and n (assume m<n). Display the number of Composite Magic integers that are in the range
between m and n and output them along with frequency, in the format specified below.
Example- Input: m=20, n=95
Output: The Composite Magic integers are: 28, 46, 55, 64, 82, 91
Frequency of Composite Magic integers is = 6
