/*
 A Goldbach number is a positive even integer that can be expressed as the sum of two odd primes.
Example: 6 = 3 + 3
10 = 3 + 7
16 = 5 + 11c
Write a program to input an even integer n where n> 9 and n< 100. Find all the odd prime pairs whose sum is equal to the
number n.
Test your program with the following sample data.
Example 1- Input n = 22
Output: Prime pairs are: 3, 19
5, 17
11, 11
Example 2- Input n = 25
Output: Invalid Input. Number is Odd.
Example 3- Input n = 128
Output: Invalid Input. Number out of range.
