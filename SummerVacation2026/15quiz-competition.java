/*
The result of a quiz competition is to be prepared as follows:
The quiz has five questions with four multiple choices (A, B, C, D) with each question carrying 1 mark for the correct answer.
Design a program to input the number of participants n such that n must be greater than 3 and less than 11. Create a double
dimensional array of size (nx5) to store the answers of each participant row-wise. Calculate the marks for each participant by
matching the correct answer stored in a single dimensional array of size 5. Display the scores for each participant and also
the participant having the highest score.
Example:1) Input: n = 4
Participant 1 A C C B D
Participant 2 B C A A C
Participant 3 B C B A A
Participant 4 C C D D B
Key : A C D B B
Output: Scores:
Participant 1 = 3
Participant 2 = 1
Participant 3 = 1
Participant 4= 3
Highest score: Participant 1
Participant 4
2) Input: n = 13
Output: Input size is out of range.
